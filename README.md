# Create cylindrical phantom in dosxyznrc
[dosxyznrc](http://nrc-cnrc.github.io/EGSnrc/doc/pirs794-dosxyznrc.pdf) is wonderful Monte Carlo simulation code in [EGSnrc](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/egsnrc_index.html)<br>
However, since dosexyznrc is intended for the phantom defined on cartesian coodinate, making cylindrical shape phantom on GUI is not available.<br>
Here I created a python script which is intended to make cylindrical shaped phantom that can be used in the simulation of dosxyznrc.
